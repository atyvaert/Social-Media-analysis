# SMWA_Performance

Our topic:
We look at the stock price of Netflix as dependent variable and the #Netflix tweets as the independent variable.
So, we take a dive into the effect of the tweets about Netflix on their stock price.


More concrete,
we look at the difference of the open and close stock price each day. Then we compare this with the sentiment analysis score (Likert?) of that day.
The goal is also to get insights.


We found a bot in our tweets. The bot tweeted the same tweets about Poshmark. All the words of that tweet formed their own island in the wordgraph.
